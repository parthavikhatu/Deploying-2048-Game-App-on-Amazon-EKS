✅ Project Description
A Kubernetes End-to-End (E2E) project for deploying the 2048 game app on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). This involves setting up, deploying, and managing the game on a Kubernetes cluster running on AWS EKS, showcasing containerization, deployment, and cluster management.

🐳 Containerization
Containerized the 2048 game using Docker by creating a Dockerfile that defines the application's runtime environment and dependencies, resulting in a Docker image ready for deployment.

☁️ Amazon EKS Setup
Set up an Amazon EKS cluster by configuring the necessary resources, network settings, authentication, and permissions to interact with the EKS cluster using AWS services.

🚀 Deployment
Deployed the containerized 2048 game on the EKS cluster using Kubernetes. Defined Kubernetes deployment and service YAML files to ensure the application's efficient management and availability.

📈 Scaling and Management
Explored Kubernetes' scaling capabilities, adjusting the number of application replicas based on demand to handle varying levels of user traffic seamlessly.

🌐 Application Exposure
Created a Kubernetes service to securely expose the 2048 game over the internet, with the option to implement an Ingress controller for more advanced routing.
